# lists

The `lists` module provides very basic styling for regular ordered and
unordered lists.

## Installation

You can install the `lists` module via Bower, npm, or copy and paste.

### Install using Bower:

```sh

```

Once installed, `@import` into your project in its Base layer:

```scss
@import "bower_components/tree-lists/base.lists";
```

### Install using npm:

```sh
$ npm install tree-lists --save
```

### Install via file download

The least recommended option for installation is to simply download 
`_base.lists.scss` into your project and `@import` it into your project in
its Base layer.
